<p id="theRamojiPara">Ramoji Film City is an integrated film studio complex located in Hyderabad, India. Spread over 1,666 acres,it is the largest integrated film city in the world and as such has been certified by the Guinness World Records as the largest studio complex in the world. It was built by Telugu film producer Ramoji Rao in 1996.The Guardian described Ramoji Film City as "city within a city."
The film city is the brainchild of film producer Ramoji Rao, who wanted to build a studio similar to the ones in Hollywood. On procuring the land, he signed art director Nitish Roy to design the complex. According to an executive, the builders kept the land, which at that time consisted of jungles and mountainous terrain, intact, without removing one tree or mountain.
The studio has a central kitchen for the various film units shooting at any given point of time.
People can visit the film sets, theme parks, amusement rides, etc. The film city also has 6 hotels inside it, 47 sound stages and permanent sets ranging from railway stations to temples.
The film city also has the set used for the films Baahubali: The Beginning and Baahubali 2: The Conclusion, all the statues and props used in the films can be seen here.
It is also a popular tourism and recreation centre, containing natural and artificial attractions including an amusement park. Around 1.5 million tourists visit this place every year.</p>
